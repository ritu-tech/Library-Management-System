# Library-Management-System

**Project Description**

This project designs a Library database system and auditing for KSU Book Kiosks. It contains a process, consisting of stored procedures that checks usernames against a list of registered users. If the users are authorized, they granted access to search book collections either by name or ISBN number. From that point, the user can request the desired book or return a book when it is due. Administrators are authorized to print weekly reports for each kiosk.
